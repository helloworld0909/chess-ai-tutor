"""Convert chess.Board into AlphaZero/Leela-style tensors.

Single-board tensor — (19, 8, 8):
  0-5:   White pieces (P N B R Q K)
  6-11:  Black pieces (P N B R Q K)
  12:    Side to move (all-1 if White, all-0 if Black)
  13:    White kingside castling right
  14:    White queenside castling right
  15:    Black kingside castling right
  16:    Black queenside castling right
  17:    En passant file (1 in the EP file column)
  18:    Move number (normalized to [0,1], assuming max ~200)

Combined before+after tensor — (38, 8, 8):
  0-18:  Board before the move  (19 channels above)
  19-37: Board after the move   (19 channels above)

When no move is provided (static position query), channels 19-37 = channels 0-18
(identity / null-move convention). The ResNet sees zero delta and learns to represent
the position without any move context.
